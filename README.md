## Objective

* My objective was to develop a full-stack web application that creates lodging listings to help users find accomodations. The app is intended to accept a users' location, dates (check-in/out), and price-per-night as parameters for its searches. Appter also enables a dual interface between renters (individuals renting-out their apartments) and guests.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS/SASS
* Javascript
* JQuery
* Handlebars
* AJAX
* Bootstrap

## Thought Process & Execution

*

## User Stories & Wireframe

* After accessing the webpage users can sign-up/create an account which will render a success or error message.
* Users will be able to sign-in/log-in which will render a success or error message.
* Users will be able to view other their own and other users' listings by pressing a designated button to view listings.
* Users will be able to create listings, which accept address, check-in/check-out in dates, price per night as inputs. This action will also render a success or error message.
* Users will be able to delete only their own listings if desired. This action will also render a success message and an error message (particularly if users try to delete another user's listing.)
* Users will be able to update their only their own listings. Success and error messages will be rendered.
* Users will be able to sign-out/log-out. Success and error messages will be rendered in this instance as well.

## Future Versions

I planned four more versions of the app to enable users to filter data with more efficiency.
* Attach images/photos to each listing for better advertisement.
* Filter data by price per night, location, availability in dates.
* Render a map to help users locate the listings by location.
* Create a communication feature to enable users chat amongst themselves to discuss listing details.
